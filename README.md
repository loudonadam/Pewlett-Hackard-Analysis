# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview
Our analysis is aimed at helping Pewlett Hackard prepare from the coming retirement of many of it's workers. In order to do this, we would like to see how many individuals will be retiring soon, who they are, and who may be good candidates to replace them. Using these lists we can oversee a mentorship program to help the transition occur as seamlessly as possible.

## Results
- Over 3,000 engineers are likely to retire soon. 
- There are many young employees for each title which will be experiencing retirements.
- There are only a few managers likely to retire soon.
- Many senior staff are included in the list of retirees.

## Summary
Approximately 90,308 roles will need to be filled following the "silver tsunami". There should be plenty of mentors available to train the next generation of PH employees. Further research into the number of young employees in qualified roles for promotion would be very helpful. Additionally, since a potential wave of external hiring may need to take place, it would be advantageous to research how easy it is to find individuals to fill roles which may come from outside the organization.
